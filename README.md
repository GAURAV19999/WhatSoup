# WhatSoup üç≤
A web scraper that exports your entire WhatsApp chat history.

## Overview
### Problem
1) Exports are limited up to a maximum of 40,000 messages
2) Exports skip the text portion of media-messages by replacing the entire message with ```<Media omitted>``` instead of for example ```<Media omitted> My favorite selfie of us üòªüê∂ü§≥```
3) Exports are limited to a ```.txt``` file format

### Solution
*WhatSoup* solves these problems by loading the entire chat history in a browser, scraping the chat messages (only text, no media), and exporting it to ```.txt```, ```.csv```, or ```.html``` file formats.

**Example output**: 

*WhatsApp Chat with Bob Ross.txt*
