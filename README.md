# WhatSoup üç≤
A web scraper that exports your entire WhatsApp chat history.

## Overview
### Problem
1) Exports are limited up to a maximum of 40,000 messages
2) Exports skip the text portion of media-messages by replacing the entire message with ```<Media omitted>``` instead of for example ```<Media omitted> My favorite selfie of us üòªüê∂ü§≥```
3) Exports are limited to a ```.txt``` file format

### Solution
*WhatSoup* solves these problems by loading the entire chat history in a browser, scraping the chat messages (only text, no media), and exporting it to ```.txt```, ```.csv```, or ```.html``` file formats.

**Example output**: 

*WhatsApp Chat with Bob Ross.txt*

## Demo
[![Watch the video on YouTube](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eddyharrington/WhatSoup/master/docs/demo.gif)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3lNYk8pPeQ)

## Prerequisites
1) You have a WhatsApp account
2) You have Chrome browser installed
3) You have some familiarity with setting up and running Python scripts
4) Your terminal supports unicode (UTF-8) characters (for chat emoji's)

## Instructions
1) Clone the repo:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/eddyharrington/WhatSoup.git
    ```

2) Create a virtual environment:

    ```
    # Windows
    python -m venv env

    # Linux & Mac
    python3 -m venv env
    ```

3) Activate the virtual environment:

    ```
    # Windows
    env/Scripts/activate

    # Linux & Mac
    source env/bin/activate
    ```

4) Install the dependencies:

    ```
    # Windows
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Linux & Mac
    python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5) Setup your environment

- Download [ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) and extract it to a local folder (such as the ```env``` folder)
- Get your Chrome browser ```Profile Path``` by opening Chrome and entering ```chrome://version``` into the URL bar
- Create an ```.env``` file with an entry for ```DRIVER_PATH``` and ```CHROME_PROFILE``` that specify the directory paths for your ChromeDriver and your Chrome Profile from above steps:

    ```
    # Windows
    DRIVER_PATH = 'C:\path-to-your-driver\chromedriver.exe'
    CHROME_PROFILE = 'C:\Users\your-username\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data'

    # Linux & Mac
    DRIVER_PATH = '/Users/your-username/path-to-your-driver/chromedriver'
    CHROME_PROFILE = '/Users/your-username/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default'
    ```

5) Run the script

    ```
    # Windows
    python whatsoup.py

    # Linux & Mac
    python3 whatsoup.py
    ```

    **Note for Mac users**: you may get blocked when trying to run the script the first time with a message about chromedriver not being from an identified developer. This is normal. Follow [these instructions](https://stackoverflow.com/a/60362134) to grant chromedriver an exception, then re-run the script.
